# Getting Started Conditional Rendering

- You can return a JSX expression conditionally with an if statement.
- You can conditionally save some JSX to a variable and then include it inside other JSX by using the curly braces.
- In JSX, {cond ? <A /> : <B />} means “if cond, render <A />, otherwise <B />”.
- In JSX, {cond && <A />} means “if cond, render <A />, otherwise nothing”.
